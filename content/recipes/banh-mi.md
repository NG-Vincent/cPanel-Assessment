This banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) is made with chicken and full of pickled vegetables. My husband works around a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I was making him bring me home these tasty sandwiches. Finally I attempted to make one, and found that my recipe was even better than the restaurants', mainly because I used chicken breast and fresher ingredients. I also love the pickled vegetables, so I make sure there are plenty of those.
